*********************
* Bit sequences
*********************
*
* QCD input patterns are declared in groups of the form
*
* [bit_sequence_set] <name>
*      Stimulus <Tx Designator> <Stimulus_name> [<Stimulus_name> ...]
*      Pattern  <Tx Designator> <Pattern_name> [<Pattern_name> ...]
* [End_bit_sequence_set]
* 
* There are twp types of bit sequence declarations: Stimulus and Pattern
* Stimulus declarations are used for time-domain SPICE analysis
* Pattern declarations are used for time-domain QCD analysis
*
* Bit sequences are defined in the named bit sequence file accessed
* from the EDit Named Bit Sequences button on the Bit Sequence Setup
* dialog (Setup->Bit Sequence) or from the menu item
* Setup->Named Bit Sequences
*
* Note that Stimulus and Pattern can have the same name. Pattern
* declarations take precedence for QCD time domain analysis. If no
* Pattern data is found for a particlar designator during QCD time-domain
* analysis, the Stimulus data for that designator is used instead. If
* no Stimulus is found a random pattern will be used.
