* This example maps reference designator r123 on board 
* "motherboard" ("motherboard" is the identifier from the extraction
* control file) to CAD part number "357ohm". CAD part number "357ohm" 
* is defined in the discrete parts file as a 357 ohm resistor 
* (see example discrete parts file). The result is that the part 
* r123 will be modelled with a 357 ohm resistor in the extracted
* subcicruits. This is mainly used to change values of resistors
* for simulation without changing the CAD database.

* This example maps reference designator u1 on the board 
* "motherboard" to CAD part number "dummy". If the CAD partnumber 
* "dummy" is not defined in the discrete parts file or in the 
* layout database the component u1 will effectively be depopulated 
* from the board and not included in the extracted subcircuits.
* This is mainly used to exlude components that have special 
* "Do Not Install" build instructions from the extracted subcircuits.
