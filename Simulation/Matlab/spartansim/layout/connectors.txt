* This an example multiboard connectivity file. 

* This example connects j29 on board "motherboard" to j1 on 
* board "daughterboard". Connector mapping is not needed, ie
* pin 1 of j29 connects to pin 1 of j1. The connector will 
* be modelled using a 120pS transmission line with 55 ohms 
* impedance. The names "motherboard" and "daughterboard" are
* the board names defined in the extraction control file.
* 
* motherboard j29 daughterboard j1 z0=55 td=120ps

* Similar example to the one above, here an actual spice 
* subcircuit "conn_model" from the file 8-row-conn.mod is used
* to model the connector
*
* motherboard j29 daughterboard j1 8-row-conn.mod conn_model

* Example using custom pin mapping. Pin 31 of connector j29
* is connected to pin 7 of connector j1. Pin 32 connects to
* pin 6 and so on.
*
* motherboard j29.31 daughterboard j1.7 z0=55 td=120ps
* motherboard j29.32 daughterboard j1.6 z0=55 td=120ps
* motherboard j29.33 daughterboard j1.5 z0=55 td=120ps
